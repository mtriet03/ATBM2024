## **AQI-ETL: Air Quality Data Processing Pipeline**
The project required students to employ a variety of techniques to enhance data security within an Oracle Database environment. These techniques included access control mechanisms, user privilege management, and auditing strategies.
We explored role-based access control (RBAC) to ensure that only authorized users could perform specific actions within the database.
Additionally, the project involved configuring fine-grained auditing (FGA) to monitor database activities and detect potential security breaches. SQL injection prevention measures were also applied to safeguard the database from malicious attacks. Lastly, we developed a Windows Forms application to demonstrate the effectiveness of these security techniques. The application allowed users with different roles to interact with the database while ensuring they could only access data and perform actions within their pre-defined permissions.
Through hands-on experience with these security techniques, students gained a deeper understanding of Oracle Database security principles and best practices for protecting data integrity and confidentiality.
